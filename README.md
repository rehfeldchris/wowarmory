##What
This project includes a crawler and a domain specific data model for certain aspects of the mmorpg World of Warcraft. The crawler
crawls the wow REST APIs, storing the records into a local mysql db. From that point on, you can use it to do whatever you like - I used it to do some analytics.

I'm not sure if it still works. I wrote this back around 2008 or so.
